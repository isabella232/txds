# Localization


Some languages are more verbose than others, meaning your design must account for text expansion and contraction in translated languages. The general rule is to plan for an average of 35% text expansion. The example below illustrates how the character length of a text string will vary from language to language.
 
English

Dutch

Chinese Simplified
Transifex 使得本地化容易。

Hindi
Transifex स्थानीयकरण आसान बनाता है।
