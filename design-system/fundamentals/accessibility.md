# Accessibility


### WCAG ✏️ (review)
As a digital team we strive to make all efforts necessary to meet Level AA (including Level A) success criteria of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The latest WCAG guidelines can be found here ↗

### Color ✏️
Some people find it hard or impossible to see specific colors, either as a standalone color, or when combined with a particular secondary color. Level AA criteria (of WCAG) requires that the foreground and background colors have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio ↗. There is a tool in the resources below to check your designs for color compliancy.

### Links ✏️
Color shouldn’t be used as the sole method of conveying meaning or distinguishing visual elements (this is a Level A criteria). Underlining links is common place online. If this isn’t appropriate to the design then the link must be sufficiently different in contrast from the surrounding text (e.g. the link could be accompanied by an arrow or icon).

### Forms ✏️
All form fields (e.g. text input, textarea, select, radio, checkbox, fieldset) should include a label. A label clearly identifies what the user needs to do with the accompanying form field. A label is a good visual indication, but it’s also important for accessibility, for people who can’t or struggle to see the screen. Screen readers will read the label (and input) and instruct the user what they need to do. Without a label, the user may only hear: “Edit text.” You can see how useless this is to them. With a label, they will hear: “Username, edit text.”

### Focus states ✏️
A focus state is the styling of an element being targeted by the keyboard, or activated by the mouse. Some people navigate websites with just a keyboard. Test it out yourself: Go to a website and hit the tab key multiple times… If you’re trying to access a particular link, how do you know when to hit the enter key if you don’t know which navigation link you are ‘on’. The same applies to form fields. People will tab from one field to the next, entering text as they go. A focus state (a visual indication) is very helpful to know which element you are on. The most commonly used visual indicator is a subtle border ‘glow’.
