# Content


### Clear ✏️
Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

### Useful ✏️ 
Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

### Friendly ✏️
Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.

### Appropriate ✏️ 
Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.
