# TxDS Design Kit

The TxDS Design Kit is a living, breathing document that contains all of our visual assets \(components, iconography, color palettes, grids, etc\).

The Design Kit contains core visual styles, components, color swatches, iconography, and templates. It also has a collection of symbols and text styles for rapid design and layout prototyping. Each is designated its own page, which may be accessed via the left side panel.

*MASTER* contains the TxDS sketch library with all elements and components. The library can be imported and handled inside Sketch with it's built-in libraries feature.

*ATOMS* directory has all components into single sketch files for clearer, faster and safer versioning.
