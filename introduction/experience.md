# Experience

A general principle in Transifex UX is our focus on users’ goals. We try to be proactive, anticipating users’ next moves, hearing and supporting their needs and help them complete their tasks and gain value from our product in the most efficient, fast and secure way. 

As a User Experience Team we think, plan and design according to the following core values:

  * We are thoughtful with everything we do and strive to provide the best and most elegant solutions, even if it means sacrificing things that are urgent.
  * We choose simple over complex. We prefer to be explicit than implicit, even if it feels obvious.
  * We communicate and build our products in clear, simple ways instead of being clever.
  * Among competing hypotheses, we choose the one with the fewest assumptions [(Occam’s razor ↗)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor).
  * We prefer to do something well today rather than something perfect next week.
