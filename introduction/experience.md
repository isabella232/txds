# Experience

As UX team we think, plan and design according to the following axioms:
✓ You are thoughtful with everything you do and strive to provide the best and most
elegant solutions, even if it means sacrificing things that are urgent.
✓ You choose simple over complex. You prefer to be explicit than implicit, even if it
feels obvious.
✓ You communicate and build our products in clear, simple ways instead of being
clever.
✓ Among competing hypotheses, you choose the one with the fewest assumptions
( Occam’s razor ↗ ).
✓ You prefer to do something well today rather than something perfect next week.

We focus on users’ goals that lead people to actionable insights. We are proactive, always anticipating users’ next moves and helping them prepare for change.
Our products and services are framed by six universal experiences. Each experience offers opportunities to solve unmet needs and emotionally bond users to products. 

The core principles of user experience in Transifex products are:
Focus ✏️
Clarity ✏️
Consistency ✏️
Efficiency ✏️
Simplicity ✏️
