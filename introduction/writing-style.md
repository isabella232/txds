# Writing style


### Capitalization 

Titles, headings, labels, actions and menu items should use Sentence style capitalization (capitalizing only the first word of a sentence).

#### Example
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
A mixed-case style in which the first word of the sentence is capitalized, as well as proper nouns and other words as required by a more specific rule. This is generally equivalent to the baseline universal standard of formal English orthography.
