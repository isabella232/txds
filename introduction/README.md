# TxDS Design Language

As Transifex continues to grow it was important for us to create a design language that will reflect our brand vision and strategy but also be the source of truth and guideline for design thinking and direction.

We derive some of the best practices from print-based and digital design. Consistency, modularity, hierarchy, typography, iconography, layout and information architecture are few key elements that create a unique and authentic graphic interface that immerse the user in the experience. 

Our goal with TxDS is to create a harmonious design system that will be usable, efficient, unique and powerful, but also versatile and flexible to adapt into new conditions, environments or use cases.

The TxDS Design Language spec document is a living place that will be updated as we continue to discover, think, innovate and develop new ideas and solutions for Transifex products and services.
