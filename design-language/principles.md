# Principles

As Transifex continues to grow it is important we define and document our design language that will unite all our design philosophies and methodologies across our platform and products. 

Having a cohesive language creates harmony within a platform. For onlookers, standardised colours, interactions and patterns creates a sense of familiarity and security. A well planned and well executed design language is the key to a gratifying experience. 

Simplicity and modularity are the core elements of our design language.

Simplicity is easily to quote but often ignored in strange ways. A language which uses fewer basic elements to achieve the same power is simpler.

Modularity is the realization that any system, no matter how big and wonderful it seems, should always be designed to be a part of another larger system. 

Our core axioms are at the heart of how we approach product design and development and derive from Transifex core value “Advocate for simplicity”.
