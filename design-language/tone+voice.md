# Tone & Voice

Our voice is the core of our personality, and is gender-neutral, not masculine or feminine. Our tone expresses the mood or feeling of the voice, which can change based on the situation. 

Following are our principles when communicating and talking to people we are:

#### Expert
  * We’re 'professional' but 'chill'. 
  * We communicate clearly without sounding too formal or stiff. 

#### Friendly
  * We’re warm and welcoming to our members, partners, and friends.
  * We’re hospitable and we want people to feel at home.
  * We’re human. We’re not robots or scripted.

#### Proud
  * We speak with pride about our product, experience, members, team, and company.
  * We take responsibility for our mistakes and avoid empty apologies by resolving issues as quickly as possible.

#### Supportive
  * We respect and support our users every time in the most responsive way. 
  * We present facts. 

#### Honest
  * We’re transparent. We always speak the truth and never say things to appease.
  * We keep it simple and get to the point. 
  * We don’t over-promise or exaggerate.
