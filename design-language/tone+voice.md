# Tone & Voice

Our voice is ‘professional but chill’. We communicate clearly without sounding too formal or stiff. Think about how you’d talk to a friend—that’s how we should sound on paper and in our digital products. We like to sound relatable, so feel free to use contractions ↗ (e.g. ‘can’t’ instead of ‘cannot’). We do, however, use correct grammar and punctuation and avoid text-speak like BRB or 2nite.

### Passionate
* We’re all about forward momentum. Our voice should convey this energy.
* We’re not extreme or intense.
* Treat exclamation points (!) like a spice. Don’t ruin the dish. Use them sparingly and never use more than one.
* We say “amazing” instead of “great” and “beautifully designed” instead of “well-designed.”

### Proud
* We speak with pride about our product, experience, members, team, and company.
* We take responsibility for our mistakes and avoid empty apologies by resolving issues as quickly as possible.
* Instead of saying “we apologize” or “we’re sorry,” we say “we appreciate your understanding” or “we’re working diligently to resolve the issue.”

### Honest
* We present facts. We always speak the truth and never say things to appease.
* We’re transparent and tell it like it is.
* We don’t over-promise or exaggerate.
* We don’t mince words or bullshit.

### Inviting
* We’re warm and welcoming to our members, partners, and friends.
* We’re hospitable—we want people to feel at home.
* We’re human. We’re not robots or scripted.
* Our voice is gender-neutral, not masculine or feminine.

### Simple
* We keep it simple and get to the point.
* We’re never corny. No need for clever jokes or puns.
