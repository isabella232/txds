# ðŸ’Ž TxDS Library

The **TxDS Library** contains all building blocks of Transifex application. 

We use Sketch to design from simple to advanced flowchart to complete interactions and to maintain our libraries. 

Also Sketch has some plugins that we think are essential for your workflow which you should have installed to make your life easier. 

The complete **TxDS Library** consists of seperate libraries for Color, Iconography, Typography and the Design Kit (whichever version one uses -- at the time of writing version 0.2). 

This helps us scale each organism independently without affecting the others and also iterate on the never ending components library or **TxDS_Design_Kit**.
